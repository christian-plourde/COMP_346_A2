About The File Layout:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layout of the files is as follows:

-The base directory contains a folder for each task. This contains all the source code as well as an output.txt file
 that contains the same information that was output to the console.

-The naming convention for tasks is: A2_T1 corresponding to task 1, A2_T2 corresponding to task 2, etc. 

-Each folder is independent of the others and contains only the things necessary for that particular task. Therefore
 each one can be compiled and tested separately.
